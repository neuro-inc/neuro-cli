.. class:: Jobs

   Jobs subsystem, available as :attr:`Client.jobs`.

   User can start new job, terminate it, get status, list running jobs etc.

   .. method:: attach(id: str, *, \
                      tty: bool = False, \

                      cluster_name: Optional[str] = None, \
                 ) -> AsyncContextManager[StdStream]
      :async:

      Get access to standard input, output, and error streams of a running job.

      :param str id: job :attr:`~JobDescription.id` to use for command execution.

      :param bool tty: ``True`` if :term:`tty` mode is requested, default is ``False``.

      :param bool stdin: ``True`` to attach stdin, default is ``False``.

      :param bool stdout: ``True`` to attach stdout, default is ``False``.

      :param bool stderr: ``True`` to attach stderr, default is ``False``.

      :param str cluster_name: cluster on which the job is running.

                               ``None`` means the current cluster (default).

      :return: Asynchronous context manager which can be used to access
               stdin/stdout/stderr, see :class:`StdStream` for details.

   .. method:: exec(id: str, cmd: str, *, \
                      tty: bool = False, \

                 ) -> AsyncContextManager[StdStream]
      :async:

      Start an exec session, get access to session's standard input, output, and error streams.

      :param str id: job :attr:`~JobDescription.id` to use for command execution.

      :param str cmd: the command to execute.

      :param bool tty: ``True`` if :term:`tty` mode is requested, default is ``False``.

      :param bool stdin: ``True`` to attach stdin, default is ``False``.

      :param bool stdout: ``True`` to attach stdout, default is ``False``.

      :param bool stderr: ``True`` to attach stderr, default is ``False``.

      :param str cluster_name: cluster on which the job is running.

                               ``None`` means the current cluster (default).

      :return: Asynchronous context manager which can be used to access
               stdin/stdout/stderr, see :class:`StdStream` for details.

                 ) -> Mapping[str, int]
      :async:

      Get counts of available job for specified cluster for each available preset.

      The returned numbers reflect the remaining *cluster capacity*. In other words, it
      displays how many concurrent jobs for each preset can be started at the moment of
      the method call.

      The returned capacity is an approximation, the real value can differ if already
      running jobs are finished or another user starts own jobs at the same time.

      :param str cluster_name: cluster for which the request is performed.

                               ``None`` means the current cluster (default).

                                                   The parameter can be a set or list of
                                                   requested statuses,
                                                   e.g. ``{JobStatus.PENDIND,
                                                   JobStatus.RUNNING}`` can be used for
                                                   requesting only scheduled and running
                                                   job but skip finished and failed
                                                   ones.

                                                   Empty sequence means that jobs with
                                                   all statuses are returned (default
                                                   behavior). The list can be pretty
                                                   huge though.

      :param str name: Filter jobs by :attr:`~JobDescription.name` (exact match).

                       Empty string or ``None`` means that no filter is applied (default).

                                         Retrieves only jobs submitted with all tags from the specified list.

                                         Empty list means that no filter is applied (default).

                                           for details).

                                           No owners filter is applied if the iterable
                                           is empty.

      :param ~datetime.datetime since: filter jobs by their creation date.

                                       (including) if it is not ``None``.  If the parameter
                                       is a naive datetime object, it represents local time.

                                       ``None`` means that no filter is applied (default).

                                       is a naive datetime object, it represents local time.

                                       ``None`` means that no filter is applied (default).

      :param bool reverse: iterate jobs in the reverse order.

                           If *reverse* is false (default) the jobs are iterated in
                           the order of their creation date, from earlier to later.
                           If *reverse* is true, they are iterated in the reverse order,
                           from later to earlier.

      :param int limit: limit the number of jobs.

                        ``None`` means no limit (default).

                                       (including) if it is not ``None``.  If the parameter
                                       is a naive datetime object, it represents local time.

                                       ``None`` means that no filter is applied (default).

      :param str separator: string which will separate archive and live logs
                            (if both parts are present).

                            By default a string containing random characters are used.
                            Empty *separator* suppresses output of separator.

      :param bool pass_config: a flag that specifies that platform should pass
                                 config data to job. This allows to API and CLI

                                       because of total running jobs quota.

                                   ones with lower priority. Priority should be
                                   supported by cluster.
