Neuro SDK/CLI 22.1.1 (2022-01-18)
=================================

Features
--------

- Add command `neuro acl list-roles` to list roles created by user. ([#2496](https://github.com/neuro-inc/platform-client-python/issues/2496))
- Added support to set/update cluster level default credits and quota.

  Use options `--default-credits` and `--default-jobs` of commands `neuro admin add-cluster`,
  `neuro admin update-cluster`, `neuro admin add-org-cluster` and `neuro admin update-org-cluster`
  to set and update cluster defaults. This values will when new user with role "user" is added to cluster
  (either by `neuro admin add-cluster-user` or if user registers himself using web interface).
  The default for managers and admins is unlimited quota and credits as the can edit their quota.

  You can override default value by using `--credits` and `--jobs` options of
  `neuro admin add-org-cluster` command. ([#2520](https://github.com/neuro-inc/platform-client-python/issues/2520))

- Implement public URI helpers. ([#2253](https://github.com/neuro-inc/platform-client-python/issues/2253))
- Reworked blob storage support:

  Bucket management commands:
  - use `neuro blob mkbucket` to create new bucket
  - use `neuro blob lsbucket` to list your buckets
  - use `neuro blob statbucket <bucket_id>` to retrieve info about single bucket
  - use `neuro blob rmbucket <bucket_id>` to delete bucket. Note that you can only delete empty buckets.

  Users can name buckets objects. The name should be unique between users buckets and can be used
  instead of bucket id.

  Bucket contents management commands:
  - use `neuro blob ls blob:<bucket_id>/<path_in_bucket>` to list bucket contents. Option `-r`
  disables file system emulation and displays all keys that start with <path_in_bucket>.
  - use `neuro blob glob blob:<bucket_id>/<glob_pattern>` to glob search objects in buckets.
  For example, `blob:my_bucket/**/*.txt` pattern will match all `.txt` files in `my_bucket`
  bucket.
  - use `neuro blob cp <src_uri> <dst_uri>` to copy data from/to bucket.
  - use `neuro blob rm blob:<bucket_id>/<path_in_bucket>` to delete elements from bucket. ([#2258](https://github.com/neuro-inc/platform-client-python/issues/2258))
- Implement URI autocompletion for bash shell. ([#2259](https://github.com/neuro-inc/platform-client-python/issues/2259))
- Added way to create persistent credentials to buckets to use in outside of the platform:

  - use `neuro blob mkcredentials <bucket1_id> <bucket2_id> ...` to create new credentials for specified buckets
  - use `neuro blob lscredentials` to list your buckets credentials
  - use `neuro blob statcredentials <credentials_id>` to retrieve info about single bucket credentials
  - use `neuro blob rmbucket <credentials_id>` to delete bucket credentials.

  Users can name buckets credentials. The name should be unique between users buckets credentials and can be used
  instead of bucket credentials id. ([#2264](https://github.com/neuro-inc/platform-client-python/issues/2264))


Deprecations and Removals
-------------------------

- Deprecate `neuro run IMAGE CMD`, use `neuro run IMAGE -- CMD` instead. The same for `neuro exec` command. ([#2260](https://github.com/neuro-inc/platform-client-python/issues/2260))
- Remove deprecated options older than 6 months. ([#2262](https://github.com/neuro-inc/platform-client-python/issues/2262))
